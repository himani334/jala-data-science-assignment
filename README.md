📊 JALA Academy Final Data Science Assignment

🧾 Overview

This repository contains a complete submission of the JALA Academy Final Assignment for Data Science. All tasks have been implemented using manual Python logic (without using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, etc.) as per the assignment's strict criteria.

🧠 Topics Covered

🟦 NumPy (Manual Equivalent)

Min-max scaling, broadcasting, element-wise ops

Matrix multiplication, dot & cross product

Unique element extraction, reshape, identity matrix

🟨 Pandas (Manual Equivalent)

CSV load (simulated), filtering, merging (inner/left)

Grouping, pivot tables, label encoding, type conversion

Handling NaN, creating new columns, apply-like logic

🧼 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removing duplicates, filling missing values

Normalization (Min-Max), error handling for conversions

📈 Time Series & EDA (Manual)

Manual timestamp parsing

Rolling average computation

Finding max timestamp from log entries

🚫 Restrictions Followed

❌ No use of NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn or any data science libraries

✅ All operations are implemented using basic Python: lists, dicts, loops, conditionals

💡 Where advanced operations like SVD were required, logic was explained, not executed

🧪 Notes

You can run each .py file individually to test corresponding sections.

Data samples are embedded within the files for simplicity.

All task numbers and logic blocks are clearly commented for easy review.
